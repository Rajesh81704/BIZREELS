# Changelog

All notable changes to the BizReels local social commerce platform will be documented in this file.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added & Changed
* **Production-Grade Role-Targeted Offer Isolation**:
  * **Context-Aware Scoping (`GET /api/v1/offers/active`)**: Enhanced endpoint in `backend/src/routes/offer.routes.js` and `backend/src/services/offer/client.offer.service.js` to accept `?role=vendor|creator|customer`. Strictly queries MongoDB for target roles and isolates Redis cache keys per role segment (`offers:active:v${version}:role:${role}`).
  * **DTO Completeness**: Updated `clientOfferService.getActiveOffers` to return `targetRoles` and `isVendorOffer` in the mapped DTO.
  * **Client Defense-in-Depth (`ActiveOffersPanel.jsx`)**: Updated frontend panel to pass `{ params: { role } }` in API requests and eliminated `!o.targetRoles` wildcard escape hatch. Added strict role verification on real-time WebSocket events (`offer:activated`, `offer:updated`).
  * **Dynamic Audience Badging**: Added dynamic badges to offer cards (`Vendor Exclusive` with amber accents, `Creator Special` with purple accents, `Special Deal` with emerald accents).
  * **Checkout Coupon Role Security (`POST /api/v1/offers/validate-coupon`)**: Added strict role eligibility verification ensuring customers cannot redeem seller-exclusive or creator-exclusive discounts.
  * **Dynamic Notification Redirection**: In `backend/src/jobs/offerScheduler.js`, updated newly scheduled offer notifications to route dynamically to `/vendor/dashboard`, `/creator/dashboard`, or `/customer/home`.
* **Documentation & API Keys Synchronization**:
  * Fully synchronized `docs/devops/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` with active `.env` configuration, documenting `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SANDBOX_API_KEY`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `REDIS_URL`, `EXOTEL_API_KEY`, and `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.
  * Updated Section 23 of `docs/api/ENDPOINTS.md` and `docs/api/CONTRACT_SUMMARY.md` with exact query parameters, payload contracts, and response schemas for `/offers/active`, `/offers/validate-coupon`, and `/offers/applicable`.
  * Updated `docs/domain-reports/VENDOR_OFFERS.md` to detail role-targeted dashboard isolation and checkout security.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added & Changed
* **Direct CDN Stream Architecture (Approach 1) for Reels & Media Uploads**:
  * **Zero-RAM Direct CDN Uploads**: Integrated client-side streaming engine in `frontend/src/lib/api.js` (`mediaApi.uploadMediaStream`) utilizing `POST /api/v1/media/sign`. Binary video and image files up to 50MB stream directly from the vendor's browser to Cloudinary's Edge CDN with real-time percentage progress tracking (`onUploadProgress`).
  * **Payload Optimization & 413 Entity Too Large Resolution**: Eliminated Base64 data encoding in reel creation requests. Reel publication payload (`POST /api/v1/reels`) reduced from 35MB–50MB down to `< 1 KB` (clean CDN URL only), preventing Node.js Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes and event-loop thread blocking.
  * **Express Payload Guards & 413 Error Handler**: Reverted global `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` limits back to secure `10mb` in `backend/src/app.js`. Added dedicated operational handler in `errorHandler.js` for `entity.too.large` / HTTP 413.
  * **In-Flight Upload Guards**: Added safeguards in `VendorReelsPage.jsx` and `ReelPreviewModal.jsx` disabling publish actions with visual loader indicators while media is actively uploading to CDN.
* **Mongoose 9 `pre('save')` Middleware Fixes**:
  * Removed legacy `next()` callback invocation in `backend/src/models/Reel.js` and `backend/src/models/Offer.js` to conform with Mongoose 9 synchronous pre-save hooks, resolving the critical `next is not a function` publishing crash.
  * Increased database connection and server selection timeouts to 30,000ms in `connection.js` to eliminate false Atlas disconnects during intermittent network spikes.
* **Warm Bento-Brutalism Design Modernization**:
  * Completely redesigned `CreateReelWizardModal.jsx`, `CreateProductModal.jsx`, `CreateServiceModal.jsx`, and `ReelBoostModal.jsx` to match BizReels' warm beige theme (`#f8f4ec` containers, `#e3dccb` borders, amber action accents, and `Outfit`/`Archivo` typography).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added
* **Production-Grade Admin Reels Governance & Modular Architecture**:
  * **Modular Reel Subservice Layer (`backend/src/services/reel/`)**:
    * Implemented `admin.reel.service.js` encapsulating live telemetric aggregations, multi-criteria server-side query filters, soft takedowns, restores, boost management, and atomic bulk operations.
    * Added clean facade pattern (`backend/src/services/reel/index.js`) and refactored `admin.routes.js` to eliminate inline queries and delegate cleanly to the service layer.
    * Integrated formal `AuditLog` persistence and real-time WebSocket event broadcasts (`reel:takedown`, `reel:restored`, `reel:boosted`, `admin:update`).
  * **New Administrative Reels API Endpoints**:
    * `GET /admin/reels/stats`: Live platform aggregation returning total catalog count, trending count, views, likes, comments, boosted reels, and review queue depth.
    * `GET /admin/reels`: Multi-criteria catalog query supporting server-side regex search, postType filters, and creator/listing population.
    * `POST /admin/reels/:id/takedown` & `POST /admin/reels/:id/restore`: Soft deletion and instant restoration with audit logging.
    * `POST /admin/reels/:id/moderate`: Policy moderation review recording formal approval/rejection with preset violation categories.
    * `POST /admin/reels/:id/boost`: Discovery boost toggle with 7-day expiration handling.
    * `POST /admin/reels/bulk-action`: Atomic batch execution for bulk takedown, bulk restore, bulk boost, and bulk approve.
  * **Modular Frontend Component Hierarchy (`frontend/src/pages/admin/reels/components/`)**:
    * Refactored monolithic page into focused subcomponents: `ReelKpiBanner`, `ReelFilterBar`, `ReelBatchActionBar`, `ReelTable`, `ReelPreviewModal`, `ReelModerateModal`, and `reelUtils.js`.
    * Main `AdminReelsPage.jsx` maintained as a clean, declarative orchestrator under 200 lines.
    * Integrated real-time count badges into `AdminTabBar` reflecting live database stats without polling.
  * **Strict Warm Bento-Brutalism Theme Alignment**:
    * Completely eradicated legacy cool purple, blue, and pink styling in favor of the website design tokens (`#fbf9f4`, `#f8f4ec`, `#e3dccb`, `#1a1a1a`, `#d99a3d`, `Archivo Black` / `Outfit` typography).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added
* **Production-Grade Creator Revenue & Escrow Architecture**:
  * **True Escrow Holding**: Implemented immediate wallet debiting on vendor campaign proposal creation (`escrowStatus: 'held'`), eliminating default risk while creators work on deliverables.
  * **Dynamic Platform Take-Rate & Commission Ledger**: Integrated platform fee calculation (5% default via `commissionService`) with automatic split into creator net payout (`netCreatorAmount`) and platform commission ledger (`Commission`).
  * **Automated Escrow Lifecycle**: Built automatic escrow refunds on proposal cancellation or creator rejection (`escrowStatus: 'refunded'`), budget adjustments on proposal edit, and automated net release upon campaign completion or 100% milestone approval (`escrowStatus: 'released'`).
  * **Role-Targeted Wallet Routing**: Enhanced `walletRepository.updateWalletBalance` to accept explicit `options.targetRole` (`'creator'`, `'vendor'`, `'customer'`), replacing fragile substring heuristics and synchronizing legacy `User.walletBalance` with `IsolatedWallet`.
  * **Creator Dashboard Metrics & Escrow Tracking**: Added `escrowInReview` (funds secured in progress), `grossEarnings`, and isolated net earnings to `creatorController.js` and `analyticsController.js`.
  * **Transparent Creator Dashboard UI**: Added "Escrow in Progress" stat card and per-campaign gross budget, platform fee deduction, and net take-home breakdown with `Escrow Secured` status pills.

* **Dynamic XML Sitemap & Index**: Added dynamic backend sitemap generation (`/sitemap.xml`, `/sitemap-index.xml`) indexing published listings, active categories, and verified vendors with automated ISO `lastmod` dates and `Cache-Control` headers.
* **Production Crawl Directives**: Added `robots.txt` protecting administrative, authenticated, and private customer dashboards while exposing public discovery routes to search engines.
* **Responsive Image System (`LazyImage.jsx`)**: Integrated Cloudinary AVIF/WebP auto-formatting with responsive multi-resolution `srcset` (`400w`, `800w`, `1200w`), LCP priority mode (`fetchpriority="high"`), skeleton placeholders, and CLS layout reservation.
* **Granular Rollup Code Splitting**: Restructured Vite manual chunking to split monolithic 1,047 kB bundle into modular packages (`vendor-react`, `vendor-core`, `vendor-charts`, `vendor-icons`, `vendor-ui`, `vendor-motion`).
